Omnis JSON and PostgreSQL
=========================

These are the files related to the session I gave at EurOmnis.

To try this, start with restoring the dvd rental example database from the Postgresql tutorials website (link below) and then run the stored functions script on that database.

The sample library is a Studio 9 JSON library you'll need to import. It only has those parts needed for my session and thus does not do things like offer a proper logon window, security, proper logic encapsulation into objects, etc. It just shows off how to call our stored functions and prepare or parse the JSON data related to a few key tables in the example database.

The example libary is in no way complete, I purposely kept the example simple to make it easier to discuss what was going on. Come and join me at EurOmnis next time to get the full story!

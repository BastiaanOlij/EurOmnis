This folder contains a file with the queries you'll need to reverse engineer a postgres SQL database.

There is also a small demo library that was used during the session to demonstrate the limited build in functionality for updating database tables from within Omnis.
This library also has a basic implementation of logic that will create or update tables according to the schemas that exist in the library.

I will enhance this library as time goes by to add other parts of the migration process that were discussed and demonstrated during the sessions so watch this space.

This is the omnishelp.lbs library that replaces Omnis' own help.lbs and gives you an entry point to either build a WIKI based help system or simply add a method to your libraries startup task called $openhelp and build your own.

Sample omnis internal help files.zip contains a sample help pages site for Omnis' internal help system including some instructions on how to build a help system within Omnis

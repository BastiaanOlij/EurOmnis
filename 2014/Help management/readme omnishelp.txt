This is the omnishelp.lbs library that replaces Omnis' own help.lbs and gives you an entry point to either build a WIKI based help system or simply add a method to your libraries startup task called $openhelp and build your own.

omnishelppages.zip contains a sample help pages site for Omnis' internal help system including some instructions on how to build a help system within Omnis

dokuwiki.zip contains a full installation of dokuwiki including several help pages related to both my EurOmnis sessions.

Please check back here later as I will put updated files here before the end of the conference as I'm still adding things.

The omnis.php is a syntax highlighter definition for Omnis code that can be used by Geshi: http://qbnz.com/highlighter/
At this time it is only about 50% complete and I hope to find time to fill in the blanks soon. 

I use it in combination with DokuWiki that unfortunately ignores the color scheme by default. Install the userstyle.css file into the <dokuwiki>\conf folder of dokuwiki to get the color coding to be correct.
The omnis.php goes into the <dokuwiki>\inc\geshi folder.

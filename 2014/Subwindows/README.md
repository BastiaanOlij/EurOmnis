Included here are the version of my widgets library as used for the 2014 EurOmnis session on subwindows and an example library showing this and other techniques discussed during the sessions.

There is a write-up for the basic approach on my blog here: http://bastiaanolij.blogspot.com.au/2014/10/fields-based-on-subwindows.html
